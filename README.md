# vampirefalloriginbot
This is an experimental project with the aim of increasing the understanding of AI algorithms. The code mainly focuses on the turn-based combat in the game Vampire's Fall: Origin. Since a move takes a while to calculate, it is recommended to only use in PvE. Therefore, use the code to in other ways, e.g. navigation around the open world is not recommended.

Since python is a computationally intensive project, it is recommended to run only one instance on the computer. The project is only developed for Windows and preferably all Windows versions beyond 7. You probably already have python 3 installed on your computer.

Steps to use the code:
1. Download and install tesseract OCR
2. Download and install BlueStacks 4
3. Open BlueStacks and login to PlayStore using your Google account
4. Update Google Play
5. Find and install Vampire's Fall: Origin
6. Sellect the game controll and choose open advanced editor
7. Import 'Vampire's Fall  Origins.cfg' into the controlls
8. Get the code onto your local machine e.g. download the code as zip and unzip the code
9. Navigate to the readimg.py file and edit the line 7, replace with the path of your tesseract.exe
10. Navigate to main.py file and edit the line 144, replace with the name of your BlueStacks window
11. Install all the libraries in the requirements.txt
12. Set BlueStacks to full screen
Now the code is ready to run.
